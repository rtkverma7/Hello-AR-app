# Hello AR App
My first android app using ARCore Sceneform SDK.\
This app displays a 3D Model (Arctic Fox) on a detected surface in Augmented Reality.

> Sceneform is used to render 3D scenes without us having to learn anything about OpenGL.

## Requirements

 - Android Studio **3.1** or later.
	- **3.6.x** not preferred as Sceneform is not yet supported.
 - Google Sceneform Tools plugin installed in Android Studio.
 - Android device that supports ARCore ([check here](https://developers.google.com/ar/discover/supported-devices)).
 - If you're running on emulator, install the ***ARCore-for-emulator.apk*** from [here](https://github.com/google-ar/arcore-android-sdk/releases).
	 - Set rear camera to **VirtualScene**.


**Other details are mentioned as comments in the files.**
